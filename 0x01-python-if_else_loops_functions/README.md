# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Overview

This repository contains Python code examples focusing on fundamental concepts like if/else statements, loops, and functions. These concepts are crucial for understanding the basics of programming in Python.

## Content

### 1. If/Else Statements

Explore the usage of conditional statements in Python through if/else blocks. Understand how these statements control the flow of the program based on conditions.

### 2. Loops

Learn about different types of loops in Python, including `for` and `while` loops. Dive into iterating through data structures and executing code repeatedly.

### 3. Functions

Understand the significance of functions in Python, how to define them, pass arguments, and return values. Explore the modularity and reusability they bring to your code.

## Usage

1. Python scripts here start with `#!/usr/bin/python3` so you can also run them by the command `./<script_name>.py`
2. Checking code style using Pycodestyle by running the command `pycodestyle <script_name>.py`. If you do not have Pycodestyle make sure you have pip installed first and then run `pip install pycodestyle`.

# 0x03. Python - Data Structures

This repository contains examples and explanations related to Python's data structures.

## Overview

Python provides various built-in data structures to store and manipulate data efficiently. This repository covers fundamental data structures and their usage in Python, including:

- **Lists:** Exploring lists, a versatile and mutable data structure to store a collection of items.
- **Tuples:** Understanding tuples, immutable sequences commonly used for fixed collections of elements.
- **Dictionaries:** Exploring dictionaries, unordered collections of key-value pairs for efficient data retrieval.
- **Sets:** Understanding sets, unordered collections of unique elements useful for various mathematical operations.


## Usage

1. Python scripts here start with `#!/usr/bin/python3` so you can also run them by the command `./<script_name>.py`
2. Checking code style using Pycodestyle by running the command `pycodestyle <script_name>.py`. If you do not have Pycodestyle make sure you have pip installed first and then run `pip install pycodestyle`.

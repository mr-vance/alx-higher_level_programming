# 0x02. Python - Import & Modules

This repository contains examples and explanations related to Python's import system and modules.

## Overview

Python's modular system allows you to organize code into reusable units called modules. These modules can be imported into other Python scripts, enabling code reuse, better organization, and abstraction.

This repository covers the following topics:
- **Importing Modules:** Understanding how to import modules into Python scripts using `import` statements.
- **Module Structures:** Exploring the structure of modules, including how to create, organize, and use them effectively.
- **Module Aliasing:** Techniques for aliasing modules and their elements to simplify usage or prevent naming conflicts.
- **Importing from Packages:** Importing modules from packages and subpackages, utilizing Python's package structure.
- **Namespace and Scope:** Understanding how imported modules affect namespaces and variable scope in Python.


## Usage

1. Python scripts here start with `#!/usr/bin/python3` so you can also run them by the command `./<script_name>.py`
2. Checking code style using Pycodestyle by running the command `pycodestyle <script_name>.py`. If you do not have Pycodestyle make sure you have pip installed first and then run `pip install pycodestyle`.
